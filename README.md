## Problem Statement: StackIt – A Minimal Q&A Forum Platform

StackIt aims to solve the need for a minimal, structured, and collaborative Q&A platform that promotes knowledge sharing, community learning, and user engagement. Users often struggle to find lightweight and focused solutions that support asking questions, rich text formatting, tagging, upvoting, and notifications — all within a clean and distraction-free interface. This project addresses that gap by creating an intuitive platform for structured discussions, streamlined moderation, and personalized user interactions.
